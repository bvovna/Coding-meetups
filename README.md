Demo: https://coding-meetups.vercel.app/

This is a full-stack project built with **NextJS**.
It connects to MongoDB and uses the database to add, edit and remove events(meetups).
I've also used **NextAuth** to require the user to login in order to make any changes.
The application makes use of **dynamic pages, page pre-rendering,**(both getStaticProps and getServerSideProps) as well as it's own **API with MongoDB**.
